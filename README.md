# human-tf-isoforms

This Nextflow pipeline reproduces the analysis from my PhD thesis "A computational study of nucleosomal binding and alternative isoforms of human transcription factors" [Link to the official publication in Spiral to be added in autum of 2022.]

Run this pipeline from within the repository directory as follows:

```
nextflow run main.nf -latest -profile <your_profile>
```

where `<your_profile>` is the Nextflow profile for your computational cluster or cloud service.
